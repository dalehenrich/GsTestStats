The test script will directly manipulate the test runner and reporter with no
need for a test spec. stdout and json test reports will be used locally and 
with github ci

The basic goal here is to support:
-[x] stdout reports
-[ ] json test reports
-[ ] elimination of SmalltalkCISpec ... 
-[x] eliminate xml reporter
